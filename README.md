# SF-graffiti-social-factors-research

  This is a study aims to explor the spatial relationship between graffiti occurrences and social factors using R.

  This study finds a geographical spatial relationship between three socio-economic elements and the incidence of graffiti in San Francisco, including the proportion of the population aged 15 to 24, the proportion of low-income households, and the proportion of the population with low educational levels aged 18 to 24. Through global and local Moran's I, we found that each variable exhibits varying degrees of spatial clustering, and then further revealed their correlations in different areas through Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) modeling. Their correlations demonstrate a significant degree of spatial heterogeneity, which we believe may be due to the high population density and socio-economic activities in central urban areas, making them more prone to attract graffiti activities. This attraction effect causes significant variability in the correlation of the variables in space.

note: the graffiti file is too big and can't be uploaded. It could be downloaded from: https://data.sfgov.org/City-Infrastructure/Graffiti/vg6y-3pcr, and put it under the "data_practice_exam" repo.
